# World_Weather_Analysis
### Purpose of the Project
In Retreive Weather Data, generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Then, apply the API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. In the end, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data. In create a customer travel destinations map, use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. In the end, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers. In create a travel itinerary map, use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
